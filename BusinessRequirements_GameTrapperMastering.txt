    - Berries can be found or purchased to help lure creatures into traps, make more creatures appear, calm aggressive creatures, or make creatures easier to catch.
    - Certain areas will have environmental hazards (like quicksand, poisonous plants, or extreme weather) that players must navigate while trying to trap creatures.
    - Certain creatures will only appear during specific times of the day or under certain weather conditions, encouraging players to explore the game world at different times.
    - Players can customize their characters appearance and equipment.

    - Certain creatures will have unique abilities that can assist players in trapping other creatures or navigating the environment.
    - Certain things can be locked behind skill trees that players can unlock as they progress, allowing for more advanced trapping techniques and strategies, or they can be locked behind WiFi or a code needed to get the things.
    - Creatures can be taken to laboratories once a requirement, or a couple, is, or are, met so they can unlock stronger forms or evolutions.
    - Shiny creatures will be able to be taken to a laboratory to get rewards which increase for each one given to the laboratory until the rewards are special creatures that cannot be found in the wild.
    - A rival NPC will battle you occasionally to test your strength to move on to another stage of the game, about 9 battles is enough.
